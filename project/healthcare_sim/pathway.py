        Determines and assigns the next action for a patient within this pathway using an epsilon-greedy Q-learning policy.

        This method:
            - Identifies the patient's current action on the pathway.
            - Retrieves valid next actions based on the pathway's transition matrix.
            - Selects the next action using an epsilon-greedy strategy:
                * With probability `epsilon`, selects a random valid action (exploration).
                * Otherwise, selects the action with the highest Q-value for the current state (exploitation).
            - Assigns the patient to the chosen action and updates the activity log and patient history.

        Args:
            patient (Patient): The patient object whose next action is being determined.
            q_table (defaultdict): The Q-table mapping states to action values for Q-learning.
            epsilon (float): The probability of choosing a random action (exploration rate).
            major_step (int): The current major step or episode in the simulation.

        Returns:
            tuple or None:
                - (next_action, q_state): The chosen next action (str) and the Q-learning state tuple.
                - None if no valid next action is available or the patient is not active on this pathway.
